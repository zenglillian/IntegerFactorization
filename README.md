# IntegerFactorization
Created by Lillian Zeng; Advisor: Dr. Ghaith Hiary <br/>
Description: implementations for integer factorization algorithms that find the least prime factor for an integer n. <br />
All of the implementations used C++ and GNU MP Bignum Library to do arithmetic on very large numbers. <br /> <br/>
